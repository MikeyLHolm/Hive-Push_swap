# Hive-Push_swap
This project involves sorting data on a stack, with a limited set of instructions, and the smallest number of moves. To make this happen, you will have to manipulate various sorting algorithms and choose the most appropriate solution(s) for optimized data sorting.

## Objectives
This project will make you sort data on a stack, with a limited set of instructions, using
the lowest possible number of actions. To succeed youâ€™ll have to manipulate various
types of algorithms and choose the one (of many) most appropriate solution for an
optimized data sorting.

The Push_swap project is a very simple and highly effective algorithm project: data will
need to be sorted. You have at your disposal a set of int values, 2 stacks and a set of
instructions to manipulate both stacks.
